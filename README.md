Data-driven analysis of prostate cancer tumor microenvironment and SCFA-related metabolic pathways using exploratory and statistical methods.
# Prostate Cancer Tumor Microenvironment and SCFA Pathway Analysis
## Overview
This project investigates how the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment (TME) influences metabolic pathway activity, with a particular focus on short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)–related pathways in non-gut tissue contexts. The analysis is designed as a data-driven, hypothesis-oriented exploration at the intersection of cancer biology and computational analysis.
## Research Question
How does the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment reshape metabolic pathway activity, particularly SCFA-related pathways, across patient-derived samples?
## Hypothesis
SCFA-related metabolic pathways show differential activation patterns in prostate tumor samples compared to non-tumor or less aggressive microenvironmental states, reflecting metabolic reprogramming driven by the tumor microenvironment.
## Scope of Analysis
Exploratory data analysis of prostate cancer datasets, Pathway-level investigation of metabolic activity, Basic statistical analysis and visualization,Biological interpretation of computational findings
## Relevance
Understanding metabolic adaptations within the tumor microenvironment can provide insight into prostate cancer progression and supports the application of data science approaches in translational biomedical research.
## Project Status
Initial project setup and scoping phase.
